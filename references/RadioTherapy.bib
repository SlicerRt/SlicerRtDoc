  Abstract                 = {The usefulness of neurosurgical navigation with current visualizations is seriously compromised by brain shift, which inevitably occurs during the course of the operation, significantly degrading the precise alignment between the pre-operative MR data and the intra-operative shape of the brain. Our objectives were (i) to evaluate the feasibility of non-rigid registration that compensates for the brain deformations within the time constraints imposed by neurosurgery, and (ii) to create augmented reality visualizations of critical structural and functional brain regions during neurosurgery using pre-operatively acquired fMRI and DT-MRI.Eleven consecutive patients with supratentorial gliomas were included in our study. All underwent surgery at our intra-operative MR imaging-guided therapy facility and have tumors in eloquent brain areas (e.g. precentral gyrus and cortico-spinal tract). Functional MRI and DT-MRI, together with MPRAGE and T2w structural MRI were acquired at 3 T prior to surgery. SPGR and T2w images were acquired with a 0.5 T magnet during each procedure. Quantitative assessment of the alignment accuracy was carried out and compared with current state-of-the-art systems based only on rigid registration.Alignment between pre-operative and intra-operative datasets was successfully carried out during surgery for all patients. Overall, the mean residual displacement remaining after non-rigid registration was 1.82 mm. There is a statistically significant improvement in alignment accuracy utilizing our non-rigid registration in comparison to the currently used technology (p<0.001).We were able to achieve intra-operative rigid and non-rigid registration of (1) pre-operative structural MRI with intra-operative T1w MRI; (2) pre-operative fMRI with intra-operative T1w MRI, and (3) pre-operative DT-MRI with intra-operative T1w MRI. The registration algorithms as implemented were sufficiently robust and rapid to meet the hard real-time constraints of intra-operative surgical decision making. The validation experiments demonstrate that we can accurately compensate for the deformation of the brain and thus can construct an augmented reality visualization to aid the surgeon.},

Treatment plan exports were obtained from 33 Australian and New Zealand centres during a dosimetry study. Plan information, including DVH data, was exported from the TPS at each centre and reviewed in a digital review system (SWAN). The review system was then used to produce an independent calculation ofDVHinformation for each delineated structure. The relationships between DVHs extracted from each TPS and independently calculated were examined, particularly in terms of the influence of CT scan slice and pixel widths, the resolution of dose calculation grids and the TPS manufacturer. Calculation of total volume and DVH data was consistent between SWAN and each TPS, with the small discrepancies found tending to increase with decreasing structure size. This was significantly influenced by the TPS model used to derive the data. For target structures covered with relatively uniform dose distributions, there was a significant difference between the minimum dose in each TPS-exported DVH and that calculated independently.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of knowledge on tolerance of normal tissue organs to irradiation by radiation oncologists cannot be overemphasized. Unfortunately, current knowledge is less than adequate. With the increasing use of 3-D treatment planning and dose delivery, this issue, particularly volumetric information, will become even more critical. As a part of the NCI contract N01 CM-47316, a task force, chaired by the primary author, was formed and an extensive literature search was carried out to address this issue. In this issue. In this manuscript we present the updated information on tolerance of normal tissues of concern in the protocols of this contract, based on available data, with a special emphasis on partial volume effects. Due to a lack of precise and comprehensive data base, opinions and experience of the clinicians from four universities involved in the contract have also been contributory. Obviously, this is not and cannot be a comprehensive work, which is beyond the scope of this contract.},

This paper presents a general solution to the problem of constructing a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours. This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, is constructed by separately determining an optimal surface between each pair of consecutive contours. Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed toroidal graph. A new fast algorithm for finding such cycles is utilized. Also developed is a closed-form expression, in terms of the number of contour points, for an upper bound on the number of operations required to execute the algorithm. An illustrated example which involves the construction of a minimum area surface describing a human head is included.},

target dose by further reducing target margin when using online image-guided adaptive intensity-modulated radiation therapy. However, clinical implementation of new techniques
should be explored cautiously and should include a comprehensive management strategy to address uncertainties in target definition and delineation in the preclinical implementation

  Abstract                 = {Purpose/Objective(s): Intrafractional and interfractional variation exists during the treatment of pancreatic cancer due to respiratory motion, bowel gas, patient weight loss, tumor response and peritumoral edema. This study sought to investigate interfraction organ motion and its dosimetric consequences.Materials/Methods: Initial planning KVCT images were compared to day 1 and day 30 MVCT images for 7 unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy (dose>45 Gy) using Tomotherapy. Organ motion was calculated by measuring centroid translation. Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was performed to evaluate overlapping volumes on planning and daily scans. Dose distribution was calculated on electron density calibrated daily MVCT images and projected onto daily MVCT with daily physician drawn GTV, liver, kidney and spinal cord contours. This dose distribution was also deformed onto a reference planning KVCT image using SlicerRT to create a cumulative dose volume histogram that could be compared to the original treatment plan.Results: Mean GTV and organ at risk translation were less than 1 cm with considerable variation between patients and fractions (Table 1). There was no significant difference in translation or DSC for day 1 and day 30, and for all subsequent analysis n=14. Mean DSC for GTV, liver, right kidney, left kidney and spinal cord were 0.61, 0.78, 0.74, 0.78 and 0.53, respectively. Compared to original plan, mean GTV dose was 99.5%, mean right kidney dose was 99.9%, mean left kidney dose was 103.7% and maximum spinal cord dose was 93.7%. Deformed doses were similar with mean GTV dose 100.3%, mean right kidney dose 91.2%, mean left kidney dose 93.8% and max cord dose 92.8% compared to planned. Thirteen of the fourteen daily plans evaluated had recalculated GTV V95 greater than 99%.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that there is sub-centimeter variation in anatomy between planning CT scan and daily treatment scans which vary between patients and fractions. These variations have minimal impact on GTV dose. By better understanding organ motion and its impact on dose deposition, one can potentially customize or shrink PTV margins to improve OAR sparing and allow for dose escalation to tumor.},

geometry to facilitate the design of patient treatment plans in radiotherapy.
To this end we propose a novel shape descriptor, the Overlap
Volume Histogram, which provides a rotation and translation invariant
representation of a patient’s organs at risk relative to the tumor volume.
Using our descriptor, it is possible to accurately identify database patients
with similar constellations of organ and tumor geometries, enabling
the transfer of treatment plans between patients with similar geometries.
We demonstrate the utility of our method for such tasks by outperforming
state of the art shape descriptors in the retrieval of patients with
similar treatment plans. We also preliminarily show its potential as a
quality control tool by demonstrating how it is used to identify an organ
at risk whose dose can be significantly reduced.},

The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) 

standard is now widely implemented in radiology as the standard for

diagnostic imaging. It has also been extended for use in various sub-

specialties. One of the first extensions was applied to radiation therapy 

and is known as DICOM-RT. In addition to the protocol used in the

DICOM standard, seven DICOM-RT objects—namely, RT Image, 

RT Structure Set, RT Plan, RT Dose, RT Beams Treatment Record, 

RT Brachy Treatment Record, and RT Treatment Summary Record—

have been created, each with a well-defined data model. The data 

models set the standard for integration of radiation therapy informa-

tion for an electronic patient record and would facilitate the interoper-

ability of different radiation therapy systems, thus making possible the 

sharing of information from different systems.

  Abstract                 = {In prostate radiation therapy, inter-fractional organ motion/deformation has posed significant challenges on reliable daily dose delivery. To correct for this issue, off-line re-optimization and online re-positioning have been used clinically. In this paper, we propose an adaptive images guided radiation therapy (AIGRT) scheme that combines these two correction methods in an anatomy-driven fashion. The AIGRT process first tries to find a best plan for the daily target from a plan pool, which consists of the original CT plan and all previous re-optimized plans. If successful, the selected plan is used for daily treatment with translational shifts. Otherwise, the AIGRT invokes the re-optimization process of the CT plan for the anatomy of the day, which is afterward added to the plan pool as a candidate for future fractions. The AIGRT scheme is evaluated by comparisons with daily re-optimization and online re-positioning techniques based on daily target coverage, organs at risk (OAR) sparing and implementation efficiency. Simulated treatment courses for 18 patients with re-optimization alone, re-positioning alone and AIGRT shows that AIGRT offers reliable daily target coverage that is highly comparable to daily re-optimization and significantly improves from re-positioning. AIGRT
is also seen to provide improved OAR sparing compared to re-positioning. Apart from dosimetric benefits, AIGRT in addition offers an efficient scheme to integrate re-optimization to current re-positioning-based IGRT workflow},

This problem has important aplications in biomedical research and instruction, solid modeling, and industrial inspection. The method we describe produces a triangulated mesh from the data points of the contours which is then used in conjunction with a piecewise parametric surface-fitting algorithm to produce a reconstructed surface. The problem can be broken into four subproblems: the correspondence problem (which contours should be connected by the surface?), the tiling problem (how should the contours be connected?), the branching problem (what do we do when there are branches in the surface?), and the surface-fitting problem (what is the precise geometry of the reconstructed surface?) We describe our system for surface reconstruction from sets of contours with respect to each of these subproblems. Special attention is given to the correspondence and branching problems. We present a method that can handle sets of contours in which adjacent contours share a very contorted boundary, and we describe a new approach to solving the correspondence problem using a Minimum Spanning Tree generated from the contours.},

(IGRT) to increase the accuracy of bladder irradiation using a ‘plan of the day’ adaptive radiotherapy
(ART) technique.
Materials and methods: Ten patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer underwent bladder preservation
with trimodality therapy in an ongoing trial. All patients received 64 Gy/32# to the whole bladder and
seven of them received a boost of 68 Gy/32# to the tumour bed. The ART technique entailed the generation
of six IMRT plans for each patient, using six isotropic PTVs of 5–30 mm applied to the bladder volume
(CTV) to generate the PTVs. Megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging was done to correct positioning errors
and choose the ‘plan of the day’.
Results: Post treatment MVCT scans (315 scans) were used to generate multiple anisotropic PTVs for
three hypothetical scenarios. Overall, coverage of anterior and superior walls required larger margins
than other walls. Maximum geographical miss, in spite of IGRT, was noted for the superior (13.8%) and
anterior walls (10.3%).
Conclusions: Plan of the day ART is a feasible and promising technique for optimal treatment and dose
escalation in bladder cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Monte Carlo simulations in nuclear medicine,
with accurately modeled photon transport and high-quality
random number generators, require precisely defined and often
detailed phantoms as an important component in the simulation
process. Contemporary simulation models predominantly employ
voxel-driven algorithms, but analytical models offer important advantages.
We discuss the implementation of ray-solid intersection
algorithms in analytical superquadric-based complex phantoms
with additional speed-up rejection testing for use in nuclear
medicine imaging simulations, and we make comparisons with
voxelized counterparts. Comparisons are made with well-known
cold rod : sphere and anthropomorphic phantoms. For these
complex phantoms, the analytical phantom representations are
nominally several orders of magnitude smaller in memory requirements
than are voxelized versions. Analytical phantoms facilitate
constant distribution parameters. As a consequence of discretizing
a continuous surface into finite bins, for example, time-dependent
voxelized phantoms can have difficulties preserving accurate
volumes of a beating heart. Although virtually no inaccuracy
is associated with path calculations in analytical phantoms,
the discretization can negatively impact the simulation process
and results. Discretization errors are apparent in reconstructed
images of cold rod : sphere voxel-based phantoms because of a
redistribution of the count densities in the simulated objects. These
problems are entirely avoided in analytical phantoms. Voxelized
phantoms can accurately model detailed human shapes based on
segmented computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) images, but analytical phantoms offer advantages
in time and accuracy for evaluation and investigation of imaging
physics and reconstruction algorithms in a straightforward and
efficient manner.},

To compare dose summation using a single plan (SP) approach for vaginal cuff brachytherapy (VBT) against dose summation after a rigid or deformable registration for each VBT fraction, in women with early stage endometrial cancer receiving postoperative VBT.

Methods and Materials
A retrospective analysis of 19 patients who received VBT as the sole adjuvant treatment was undertaken. For the purposes of the study, every VBT fraction was re-segmented and re-planned under the same conditions. CT-planning images were registered, initially following a rigid method and then using deformable registration. The transformation vectors were reused to warp the dose files, followed by the dose summation. Three dose accumulation scenarios were studied: (1) an SP approach, (2) a rigid dose warping summation (RDWS), (3) a deformable dose warping summation (DDWS). Each scenario was analyzed for 3 and 5 fractions to evaluate the effect of fractionation. D0.1cc, D1cc, D2cc, D5cc, D5%, and Dmean values were compared for organs at risk, such as the rectum and bladder.

Results
No statistical significances were observed in rectal parameters between SP and RDWS or between SP and DDWS. Significant SP, RDWS and DDWS Dmean, D0.1cc, and D2cc metric differences for the 5 fractions bladder scenario were observed (p = 0.0242, 0.0196, and 0.0242, respectively).

Conclusions
A multi-image planning procedure for a VBT course leads to limited differences between different summation methods. SP is an effective and acceptable surrogate for absorbed doses in organs at risk.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose: Following the ICRU-50 recommendations, geometrical uncertainties in tumor position during radiotherapy
treatments are generally included in the treatment planning by adding a margin to the clinical target
volume (CTV) to yield the planning target volume (PTV). We have developed a method for automatic calculation
of this margin.
Methods and Materials: Geometrical uncertainties of a specific patient group can normally be characterized by
the standard deviation of the distribution of systematic deviations in the patient group (S) and by the average
standard deviation of the distribution of random deviations (s). The CTV of a patient to be planned can be
represented in a 3D matrix in the treatment room coordinate system with voxel values one inside and zero outside
the CTV. Convolution of this matrix with the appropriate probability distributions for translations and rotations
yields a matrix with coverage probabilities (CPs) which is defined as the probability for each point to be covered
by the CTV. The PTV can then be chosen as a volume corresponding to a certain iso-probability level. Separate
calculations are performed for systematic and random deviations. Iso-probability volumes are selected in such
a way that a high percentage of the CTV volume (on average > 99%) receives a high dose (> 95%). The
consequences of systematic deviations on the dose distribution in the CTV can be estimated by calculation of dose
histograms of the CP matrix for systematic deviations, resulting in a so-called dose probability histogram (DPH).
A DPH represents the average dose volume histogram (DVH) for all systematic deviations in the patient group.
The consequences of random deviations can be calculated by convolution of the dose distribution with the
probability distributions for random deviations. Using the convolved dose matrix in the DPH calculation yields
full information about the influence of geometrical uncertainties on the dose in the CTV.
Results: The model is demonstrated to be fast and accurate for a prostate, cervix, and lung cancer case. A
CTV-to-PTV margin size which ensures at least 95% dose to (on average) 99% of the CTV, appears to be equal
to about 2S 1 0.7s for three all cases. Because rotational deviations are included, the resulting margins can be
anisotropic, as shown for the prostate cancer case.
Conclusion: A method has been developed for calculation of CTV-to-PTV margins based on the assumption that
the CTV should be adequately irradiated with a high probability.},

  Abstract                 = {Background and purpose: To evaluate the benefits of adaptive radiotherapy for bladder cancer in decreasing
irradiation of small bowel.
Material and methods: Five patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer received adaptive radiotherapy
to a total dose of 55.8–65 Gy with daily cone-beam computed tomography scanning. The whole bladder
was treated to 45–50.4 Gy, followed by a partial bladder boost. The plan of the day was chosen from 3 to 4
pre-planned treatment plans according to the visible extent of bladder wall in cone-beam computed
tomography images. Dose volume histograms for intestinal cavity volumes were constructed and compared
with corresponding histograms calculated for conventional non-adaptive radiotherapy with single
treatment plan of 2 cm CTV–PTV margins. CTV dose coverage in adaptive treatment technique was compared
with CTV dose coverage in conventional radiotherapy.
Results: The average volume of intestinal cavity receivingP45 Gy was reduced from 335 ± 106 cm3 to
180 ± 113 cm3 (1SD). The maximum volume of intestinal cavity spared at 45 Gy on a single patient
was 240 cm3, while the minimum volume was 65 cm3. The corresponding reduction in average intestinal
cavity volume receivingP45 Gy calculated for the whole bladder treatment only was 66 ± 36 cm3. CTV
dose coverage was improved on two out of five patients and decreased on three patients.
Conclusions: Adaptive radiotherapy considerably reduces dose to the small bowel, while maintaining the
dose coverage of CTV at similar level when compared to the conventional treatment technique.},

control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) arising from
a given dose distribution. A potential application of radiobiological modeling to
radiotherapy is the ranking of treatment plans via a more explicit determination of TCP
and NTCP values. Although the limited predictive capabilities of current radiobiological
models prevent their use as a primary evaluative tool, radiobiological modeling
predictions may still be a valuable complement to clinical experience. A convenient
computational module has been developed for estimating the TCP and the NTCP arising
from a dose distribution calculated by a treatment planning system, and characterized
by differential (frequency) dose-volume histograms (DDVHs). The radiobiological
models included in the module are sigmoidal dose response and Critical Volume NTCP
models, a Poisson TCP model, and a TCP model incorporating radiobiological
parameters describing linear-quadratic cell kill and repopulation. A number of sets of
parameter values for the different models have been gathered in databases. The
estimated parameters characterize the radiation response of several different normal
tissues and tumor types. The system also allows input and storage of parameters by
the user, which is particularly useful because of the rapidly increasing number of
parameter estimates available in the literature. Potential applications of the system
include the following: comparing radiobiological predictions of outcome for different
treatment plans or types of treatment; comparing the number of observed outcomes
for a cohort of patient DVHs to the predicted number of outcomes based on different
models/parameter sets; and testing of the sensitivity of model predictions to
uncertainties in the parameter values. The module thus helps to amalgamate and make
more accessible current radiobiological modeling knowledge, and may serve as a useful
aid in the prospective and retrospective analysis of radiotherapy treatment plans.},

Methods of executing beam intensity modulation have included individually designed
compensators, static multi-leaf collimators (MLC), dynamic MLC, and sequential (serial) tomotherapy.
We have developed helical tomotherapy as an innovative solution to overcome some
of the limitations of other IMRT systems. The unique physical design of helical tomotherapy
allows the realization of the concepts of adaptive radiotherapy and conformal avoidance. In
principle, these advances should improve normal tissue sparing and permit dose reconstruction
and verification, thereby allowing significant biologically effective dose escalation.
Recent radiobiological findings can be translated into altered fractionation schemes that aim
to improve the local control and long-term survival. This strategy is being tested at the University
of Wisconsin using helical tomotherapy with its highly precise delivery and verification
system along with meticulous and practical forms of immobilization. Innovative techniques
such optical guidance, respiratory gating, and ultrasound assessments are being designed
and tailored for helical tomotherapy use. The intrinsic capability of helical tomotherapy for
megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging for IMRT image-guidance is being optimized.
The unique features of helical tomotherapy might allow implementation of image-guided
IMRT that was previously impossible or impractical. Here we review the technological, physical,
and radiobiological rationale for the ongoing and upcoming clinical trials that will use
image-guided IMRT in the form of helical tomotherapy; and we describe our plans for testing
our hypotheses in a rigorous prospective fashion.

positions caused in voxelization is introduced. 3D models with two types of texture are built:
one in which the gray scale is nearly invariant in the background, and the other in which the
gray scale varies in the whole picture. The texture distortion of models with the two types of
texture is evaluated and a numerical analysis is given. The relationship between texture
distortion and voxelization precision is studied. Voxelization precision can be improved by
shortening the voxelization step length. Experiments show that models with textures in which
gray scale varies gradually in the whole picture need higher voxelization precision than textures
with an invariant gray scale background. In order to obtain similar display quality, the ratio of
the voxelization step length of models with the two types of texture is about 5/2.},

and a growing interest in the possibilities for adapting treatment planning and delivery over the
course of treatment. One obstacle faced by the research community has been the lack of a comprehensive
open-source software toolkit dedicated for adaptive radiotherapy ART. To address this
need, the authors have developed a software suite called the Deformable Image Registration and
Adaptive Radiotherapy Toolkit DIRART.
Methods: DIRART is an open-source toolkit developed in MATLAB. It is designed in an objectoriented
style with focus on user-friendliness, features, and flexibility. It contains four classes of
DIR algorithms, including the newer inverse consistency algorithms to provide consistent displacement
vector field in both directions. It also contains common ART functions, an integrated graphical
user interface, a variety of visualization and image-processing features, dose metric analysis functions,
and interface routines. These interface routines make DIRART a powerful complement to the
Computational Environment for Radiotherapy Research CERR and popular image-processing toolkits
such as ITK.
Results: DIRART provides a set of image processing/registration algorithms and postprocessing
functions to facilitate the development and testing of DIR algorithms. It also offers a good amount
of options for DIR results visualization, evaluation, and validation.
Conclusions: By exchanging data with treatment planning systems via DICOM-RT files and CERR,
and by bringing image registration algorithms closer to radiotherapy applications, DIRART is potentially
a convenient and flexible platform that may facilitate ART and DIR research.},

Further we present an overview of existing radiotherapy analysis software tools and check them against the stated requirements. As none of them could meet all of the demands presented herein, we analyzed possible conceptional problems and present software design solutions and recommendations to meet the stated requirements (e.g. algorithmic decoupling via dose iterator pattern; analysis database design). As a proof of concept we developed a software library "RTToolbox" following the presented design principles. The RTToolbox is available as open source library and has already been tested in a larger-scale software system for different use cases. These examples demonstrate the benefit of the presented design principles.},

They use a masked iterator to combine dose and structure set. It is presented as a key technology, but seem to be equivalent with simply processing with a stencil mask. Do they really create a mask volume from the contours and use that for all calculations? What reference volume they use as a basis of the voxelization of the contours? If the iterator can be initialized with a set of contours (instead of a binary mask) then it's nice - if not, then it's not very useful.

Multiple radiobiological models are implemented in the toolbox => good.

There are a few basic dose statistics and dose/plan comparison indices implementations => good

They use a relational database (postgresql) for storing computed results and computation algorithm parameters. Databases are not typical interfaces for medical imaging applications (they mostly use DICOM files, other proprietary file formats), so it's not a natural choice. However, databases are typical inputs for data mining applications (such as Rapidminer), so storing results in a standard relational database makes sense (strange that the authors didn't mention the connection between data mining and databases in the paper at all).

Although validation of the methods are much more difficult than implementing the methods, there is not a word on validation. How did they validate the data?},

  Abstract                 = {With on-line image guidance (IG), prostate shifts relative to the bony anatomy
can be corrected by realigning the patient with respect to the treatment fields.
In image guided intensity modulated proton therapy (IG-IMPT), because the
proton range is more sensitive to the material it travels through, the realignment
may introduce large dose variations. This effect is studied in this work and
an on-line adaptive procedure is proposed to restore the planned dose to the
target. A 2D anthropomorphic phantom was constructed from a real prostate
patient’s CT image. Two-field laterally opposing spot 3D-modulation and 24-
field full arc distal edge tracking (DET) plans were generated with a prescription
of 70 Gy to the planning target volume. For the simulated delivery, we
considered two types of procedures: the non-adaptive procedure and the on-line
adaptive procedure. In the non-adaptive procedure, only patient realignment to
match the prostate location in the planning CT was performed. In the on-line
adaptive procedure, on top of the patient realignment, the kinetic energy for
each individual proton pencil beam was re-determined from the on-line CT
image acquired after the realignment and subsequently used for delivery. Dose
distributions were re-calculated for individual fractions for different plans and
different delivery procedures. The results show, without adaptive, that both the
3D-modulation and the DET plans experienced delivered dose degradation by
having large cold or hot spots in the prostate. The DET plan had worse dose
degradation than the 3D-modulation plan. The adaptive procedure effectively
restored the planned dose distribution in the DET plan, with delivered prostate
D98%, D50% and D2% values less than 1% from the prescription. In the 3Dmodulation
plan, in certain cases the adaptive procedure was not effective
to reduce the delivered dose degradation and yield similar results as the nonadaptive
procedure. In conclusion, based on this 2Dphantom study, by updating
the proton pencil beam energy from the on-line image after realignment, this
on-line adaptive procedure is necessary and effective for the DET-based IGIMPT.
Without dose re-calculation and re-optimization, it could be easily
incorporated into the clinical workflow.},
