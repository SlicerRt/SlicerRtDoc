  abstract = {The usefulness of neurosurgical navigation with current visualizations
	is seriously compromised by brain shift, which inevitably occurs
	during the course of the operation, significantly degrading the precise
	alignment between the pre-operative MR data and the intra-operative
	shape of the brain. Our objectives were (i) to evaluate the feasibility
	of non-rigid registration that compensates for the brain deformations
	within the time constraints imposed by neurosurgery, and (ii) to
	create augmented reality visualizations of critical structural and
	functional brain regions during neurosurgery using pre-operatively
	acquired fMRI and DT-MRI.Eleven consecutive patients with supratentorial
	gliomas were included in our study. All underwent surgery at our
	intra-operative MR imaging-guided therapy facility and have tumors
	in eloquent brain areas (e.g. precentral gyrus and cortico-spinal
	tract). Functional MRI and DT-MRI, together with MPRAGE and T2w structural
	MRI were acquired at 3 T prior to surgery. SPGR and T2w images were
	acquired with a 0.5 T magnet during each procedure. Quantitative
	assessment of the alignment accuracy was carried out and compared
	with current state-of-the-art systems based only on rigid registration.Alignment
	between pre-operative and intra-operative datasets was successfully
	carried out during surgery for all patients. Overall, the mean residual
	displacement remaining after non-rigid registration was 1.82 mm.
	There is a statistically significant improvement in alignment accuracy
	utilizing our non-rigid registration in comparison to the currently
	used technology (p<0.001).We were able to achieve intra-operative
	rigid and non-rigid registration of (1) pre-operative structural
	MRI with intra-operative T1w MRI; (2) pre-operative fMRI with intra-operative
	T1w MRI, and (3) pre-operative DT-MRI with intra-operative T1w MRI.
	The registration algorithms as implemented were sufficiently robust
	and rapid to meet the hard real-time constraints of intra-operative
	surgical decision making. The validation experiments demonstrate
	that we can accurately compensate for the deformation of the brain
	and thus can construct an augmented reality visualization to aid
	the surgeon.},

	of the influence of CT scan slice and pixel widths, the resolution

	with the small discrepancies found tending to increase with decreasing

	The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) 
	
	
	standard is now widely implemented in radiology as the standard for
	
	
	diagnostic imaging. It has also been extended for use in various sub-
	
	
	specialties. One of the first extensions was applied to radiation
	therapy 
	
	
	and is known as DICOM-RT. In addition to the protocol used in the
	
	
	DICOM standard, seven DICOM-RT objects—namely, RT Image, 
	
	
	RT Structure Set, RT Plan, RT Dose, RT Beams Treatment Record, 
	
	
	RT Brachy Treatment Record, and RT Treatment Summary Record—
	
	
	have been created, each with a well-defined data model. The data 
	
	
	models set the standard for integration of radiation therapy informa-
	
	
	tion for an electronic patient record and would facilitate the interoper-
	
	
	ability of different radiation therapy systems, thus making possible
	the

  abstract = {In prostate radiation therapy, inter-fractional organ motion/deformation
	has posed significant challenges on reliable daily dose delivery.
	To correct for this issue, off-line re-optimization and online re-positioning
	have been used clinically. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
	images guided radiation therapy (AIGRT) scheme that combines these
	two correction methods in an anatomy-driven fashion. The AIGRT process
	first tries to find a best plan for the daily target from a plan
	pool, which consists of the original CT plan and all previous re-optimized
	plans. If successful, the selected plan is used for daily treatment
	with translational shifts. Otherwise, the AIGRT invokes the re-optimization
	process of the CT plan for the anatomy of the day, which is afterward
	added to the plan pool as a candidate for future fractions. The AIGRT
	scheme is evaluated by comparisons with daily re-optimization and
	online re-positioning techniques based on daily target coverage,
	organs at risk (OAR) sparing and implementation efficiency. Simulated
	treatment courses for 18 patients with re-optimization alone, re-positioning
	alone and AIGRT shows that AIGRT offers reliable daily target coverage
	that is highly comparable to daily re-optimization and significantly
	improves from re-positioning. AIGRT
	
	is also seen to provide improved OAR sparing compared to re-positioning.
	Apart from dosimetric benefits, AIGRT in addition offers an efficient
	scheme to integrate re-optimization to current re-positioning-based
	IGRT workflow},

  abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Intrafractional and interfractional variation
	exists during the treatment of pancreatic cancer due to respiratory
	motion, bowel gas, patient weight loss, tumor response and peritumoral
	edema. This study sought to investigate interfraction organ motion
	and its dosimetric consequences.Materials/Methods: Initial planning
	KVCT images were compared to day 1 and day 30 MVCT images for 7 unresectable,
	locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with radical
	radiotherapy (dose>45 Gy) using Tomotherapy. Organ motion was calculated
	by measuring centroid translation. Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)
	was performed to evaluate overlapping volumes on planning and daily
	scans. Dose distribution was calculated on electron density calibrated
	daily MVCT images and projected onto daily MVCT with daily physician
	drawn GTV, liver, kidney and spinal cord contours. This dose distribution
	was also deformed onto a reference planning KVCT image using SlicerRT
	to create a cumulative dose volume histogram that could be compared
	to the original treatment plan.Results: Mean GTV and organ at risk
	translation were less than 1 cm with considerable variation between
	patients and fractions (Table 1). There was no significant difference
	in translation or DSC for day 1 and day 30, and for all subsequent
	analysis n=14. Mean DSC for GTV, liver, right kidney, left kidney
	and spinal cord were 0.61, 0.78, 0.74, 0.78 and 0.53, respectively.
	Compared to original plan, mean GTV dose was 99.5%, mean right kidney
	dose was 99.9%, mean left kidney dose was 103.7% and maximum spinal
	cord dose was 93.7%. Deformed doses were similar with mean GTV dose
	100.3%, mean right kidney dose 91.2%, mean left kidney dose 93.8%
	and max cord dose 92.8% compared to planned. Thirteen of the fourteen
	daily plans evaluated had recalculated GTV V95 greater than 99%.Conclusions:
	This study demonstrates that there is sub-centimeter variation in
	anatomy between planning CT scan and daily treatment scans which
	vary between patients and fractions. These variations have minimal
	impact on GTV dose. By better understanding organ motion and its
	impact on dose deposition, one can potentially customize or shrink
	PTV margins to improve OAR sparing and allow for dose escalation
	to tumor.},

	important aplications in biomedical research and instruction, solid
	modeling, and industrial inspection. The method we describe produces
	a triangulated mesh from the data points of the contours which is
	then used in conjunction with a piecewise parametric surface-fitting
	algorithm to produce a reconstructed surface. The problem can be
	broken into four subproblems: the correspondence problem (which contours
	should be connected by the surface?), the tiling problem (how should
	the contours be connected?), the branching problem (what do we do
	when there are branches in the surface?), and the surface-fitting
	problem (what is the precise geometry of the reconstructed surface?)
	We describe our system for surface reconstruction from sets of contours
	with respect to each of these subproblems. Special attention is given
	to the correspondence and branching problems. We present a method
	that can handle sets of contours in which adjacent contours share
	a very contorted boundary, and we describe a new approach to solving
	the correspondence problem using a Minimum Spanning Tree generated
	from the contours.},

	based Image Guided Radiotherapy
	
	(IGRT) to increase the accuracy of bladder irradiation using a ‘plan

	(ART) technique.
	
	Materials and methods: Ten patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer
	underwent bladder preservation
	
	with trimodality therapy in an ongoing trial. All patients received
	64 Gy/32# to the whole bladder and
	
	seven of them received a boost of 68 Gy/32# to the tumour bed. The
	ART technique entailed the generation
	
	of six IMRT plans for each patient, using six isotropic PTVs of 5–30
	mm applied to the bladder volume
	
	(CTV) to generate the PTVs. Megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging was done
	to correct positioning errors
	
	and choose the ‘plan of the day’.
	
	Results: Post treatment MVCT scans (315 scans) were used to generate
	multiple anisotropic PTVs for
	
	three hypothetical scenarios. Overall, coverage of anterior and superior
	walls required larger margins
	
	than other walls. Maximum geographical miss, in spite of IGRT, was
	noted for the superior (13.8%) and
	
	anterior walls (10.3%).

  abstract = {Purpose
	
	To compare dose summation using a single plan (SP) approach for vaginal
	cuff brachytherapy (VBT) against dose summation after a rigid or
	deformable registration for each VBT fraction, in women with early
	stage endometrial cancer receiving postoperative VBT.
	
	
	Methods and Materials
	
	A retrospective analysis of 19 patients who received VBT as the sole
	adjuvant treatment was undertaken. For the purposes of the study,
	every VBT fraction was re-segmented and re-planned under the same
	conditions. CT-planning images were registered, initially following
	a rigid method and then using deformable registration. The transformation
	vectors were reused to warp the dose files, followed by the dose
	summation. Three dose accumulation scenarios were studied: (1) an
	SP approach, (2) a rigid dose warping summation (RDWS), (3) a deformable
	dose warping summation (DDWS). Each scenario was analyzed for 3 and
	5 fractions to evaluate the effect of fractionation. D0.1cc, D1cc,
	D2cc, D5cc, D5%, and Dmean values were compared for organs at risk,
	such as the rectum and bladder.
	
	
	Results
	
	No statistical significances were observed in rectal parameters between
	SP and RDWS or between SP and DDWS. Significant SP, RDWS and DDWS
	Dmean, D0.1cc, and D2cc metric differences for the 5 fractions bladder
	scenario were observed (p = 0.0242, 0.0196, and 0.0242, respectively).
	
	
	Conclusions
	
	A multi-image planning procedure for a VBT course leads to limited
	differences between different summation methods. SP is an effective
	and acceptable surrogate for absorbed doses in organs at risk.},

  year = {1999},
  volume = {43 No. 4},
  pages = {905-919},
  abstract = {Purpose: Following the ICRU-50 recommendations, geometrical uncertainties
	in tumor position during radiotherapy
	
	treatments are generally included in the treatment planning by adding
	a margin to the clinical target
	
	volume (CTV) to yield the planning target volume (PTV). We have developed
	a method for automatic calculation
	
	of this margin.
	
	Methods and Materials: Geometrical uncertainties of a specific patient
	group can normally be characterized by
	
	the standard deviation of the distribution of systematic deviations
	in the patient group (S) and by the average
	
	standard deviation of the distribution of random deviations (s). The
	CTV of a patient to be planned can be
	
	represented in a 3D matrix in the treatment room coordinate system
	with voxel values one inside and zero outside
	
	the CTV. Convolution of this matrix with the appropriate probability
	distributions for translations and rotations
	
	yields a matrix with coverage probabilities (CPs) which is defined
	as the probability for each point to be covered
	
	by the CTV. The PTV can then be chosen as a volume corresponding to
	a certain iso-probability level. Separate
	
	calculations are performed for systematic and random deviations. Iso-probability
	volumes are selected in such
	
	a way that a high percentage of the CTV volume (on average > 99%)
	receives a high dose (> 95%). The
	
	consequences of systematic deviations on the dose distribution in
	the CTV can be estimated by calculation of dose
	
	histograms of the CP matrix for systematic deviations, resulting in
	a so-called dose probability histogram (DPH).
	
	A DPH represents the average dose volume histogram (DVH) for all systematic
	deviations in the patient group.
	
	The consequences of random deviations can be calculated by convolution
	of the dose distribution with the
	
	probability distributions for random deviations. Using the convolved
	dose matrix in the DPH calculation yields
	
	full information about the influence of geometrical uncertainties
	on the dose in the CTV.
	
	Results: The model is demonstrated to be fast and accurate for a prostate,
	cervix, and lung cancer case. A
	
	CTV-to-PTV margin size which ensures at least 95% dose to (on average)
	99% of the CTV, appears to be equal
	
	to about 2S 1 0.7s for three all cases. Because rotational deviations
	are included, the resulting margins can be
	
	anisotropic, as shown for the prostate cancer case.
	
	Conclusion: A method has been developed for calculation of CTV-to-PTV
	margins based on the assumption that
	
	the CTV should be adequately irradiated with a high probability.},

	to a total dose of 55.8–65 Gy with daily cone-beam computed tomography
	scanning. The whole bladder

	Results: The average volume of intestinal cavity receivingP45 Gy was
	reduced from 335 ± 106 cm3 to
	
	180 ± 113 cm3 (1SD). The maximum volume of intestinal cavity spared

	radiobiological
	
	models prevent their use as a primary evaluative tool, radiobiological
	modeling
	
	predictions may still be a valuable complement to clinical experience.
	A convenient
	
	computational module has been developed for estimating the TCP and
	the NTCP arising
	
	from a dose distribution calculated by a treatment planning system,
	and characterized
	
	by differential (frequency) dose-volume histograms (DDVHs). The radiobiological

	parameters describing linear-quadratic cell kill and repopulation.
	A number of sets of

	The

	different normal

	on different
	
	models/parameter sets; and testing of the sensitivity of model predictions
	to
	
	uncertainties in the parameter values. The module thus helps to amalgamate

	more accessible current radiobiological modeling knowledge, and may
	serve as a useful
	
	aid in the prospective and retrospective analysis of radiotherapy

	has been the lack of a comprehensive
	
	open-source software toolkit dedicated for adaptive radiotherapy ART.
	To address this
	
	need, the authors have developed a software suite called the Deformable
	Image Registration and
	
	Adaptive Radiotherapy Toolkit DIRART.
	
	Methods: DIRART is an open-source toolkit developed in MATLAB. It
	is designed in an objectoriented
	
	style with focus on user-friendliness, features, and flexibility.
	It contains four classes of
	
	DIR algorithms, including the newer inverse consistency algorithms
	to provide consistent displacement
	
	vector field in both directions. It also contains common ART functions,
	an integrated graphical
	
	user interface, a variety of visualization and image-processing features,
	dose metric analysis functions,
	
	and interface routines. These interface routines make DIRART a powerful
	complement to the
	
	Computational Environment for Radiotherapy Research CERR and popular
	image-processing toolkits
	
	such as ITK.
	
	Results: DIRART provides a set of image processing/registration algorithms
	and postprocessing
	
	functions to facilitate the development and testing of DIR algorithms.
	It also offers a good amount
	
	of options for DIR results visualization, evaluation, and validation.
	
	Conclusions: By exchanging data with treatment planning systems via
	DICOM-RT files and CERR,
	
	and by bringing image registration algorithms closer to radiotherapy
	applications, DIRART is potentially
	
	a convenient and flexible platform that may facilitate ART and DIR

  abstract = {Radiotherapy is a fast-developing discipline which plays a major role
	in cancer care. Quantitative analysis of radiotherapy data can improve
	the success of the treatment and support the prediction of outcome.
	In this paper, we first identify functional, conceptional and general
	requirements on a software system for quantitative analysis of radiotherapy.
	Further we present an overview of existing radiotherapy analysis
	software tools and check them against the stated requirements. As
	none of them could meet all of the demands presented herein, we analyzed
	possible conceptional problems and present software design solutions
	and recommendations to meet the stated requirements (e.g. algorithmic
	decoupling via dose iterator pattern; analysis database design).
	As a proof of concept we developed a software library "RTToolbox"
	following the presented design principles. The RTToolbox is available
	as open source library and has already been tested in a larger-scale
	software system for different use cases. These examples demonstrate
	the benefit of the presented design principles.},

	They use a masked iterator to combine dose and structure set. It is
	presented as a key technology, but seem to be equivalent with simply
	processing with a stencil mask. Do they really create a mask volume
	from the contours and use that for all calculations? What reference
	volume they use as a basis of the voxelization of the contours? If
	the iterator can be initialized with a set of contours (instead of
	a binary mask) then it's nice - if not, then it's not very useful.
	
	
	Multiple radiobiological models are implemented in the toolbox =>
	good.
	
	
	There are a few basic dose statistics and dose/plan comparison indices
	implementations => good
	
	
	They use a relational database (postgresql) for storing computed results
	and computation algorithm parameters. Databases are not typical interfaces
	for medical imaging applications (they mostly use DICOM files, other
	proprietary file formats), so it's not a natural choice. However,
	databases are typical inputs for data mining applications (such as
	Rapidminer), so storing results in a standard relational database
	makes sense (strange that the authors didn't mention the connection
	between data mining and databases in the paper at all).
	
	
	Although validation of the methods are much more difficult than implementing
	the methods, there is not a word on validation. How did they validate
	the data?},

  title = {Introducing an on-line adaptive procedure for prostate image guided
	intensity modulate proton therapy},
  journal = {Phys. Med. Biol},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {56},
  pages = {4947–4965},
  abstract = {With on-line image guidance (IG), prostate shifts relative to the
	bony anatomy
	
	can be corrected by realigning the patient with respect to the treatment
	fields.
	
	In image guided intensity modulated proton therapy (IG-IMPT), because
	the
	
	proton range is more sensitive to the material it travels through,
	the realignment
	
	may introduce large dose variations. This effect is studied in this
	work and
	
	an on-line adaptive procedure is proposed to restore the planned dose
	to the
	
	target. A 2D anthropomorphic phantom was constructed from a real prostate
	
	patient’s CT image. Two-field laterally opposing spot 3D-modulation
	and 24-
	
	field full arc distal edge tracking (DET) plans were generated with
	a prescription
	
	of 70 Gy to the planning target volume. For the simulated delivery,
	we
	
	considered two types of procedures: the non-adaptive procedure and
	the on-line
	
	adaptive procedure. In the non-adaptive procedure, only patient realignment
	to
	
	match the prostate location in the planning CT was performed. In the
	on-line
	
	adaptive procedure, on top of the patient realignment, the kinetic
	energy for
	
	each individual proton pencil beam was re-determined from the on-line
	CT
	
	image acquired after the realignment and subsequently used for delivery.
	Dose
	
	distributions were re-calculated for individual fractions for different
	plans and
	
	different delivery procedures. The results show, without adaptive,
	that both the
	
	3D-modulation and the DET plans experienced delivered dose degradation
	by
	
	having large cold or hot spots in the prostate. The DET plan had worse
	dose
	
	degradation than the 3D-modulation plan. The adaptive procedure effectively
	
	restored the planned dose distribution in the DET plan, with delivered
	prostate
	
	D98%, D50% and D2% values less than 1% from the prescription. In the
	3Dmodulation
	
	plan, in certain cases the adaptive procedure was not effective
	
	to reduce the delivered dose degradation and yield similar results
	as the nonadaptive
	
	procedure. In conclusion, based on this 2Dphantom study, by updating
	
	the proton pencil beam energy from the on-line image after realignment,
	this
	
	on-line adaptive procedure is necessary and effective for the DET-based
	IGIMPT.
	
	Without dose re-calculation and re-optimization, it could be easily
	
	incorporated into the clinical workflow.},
