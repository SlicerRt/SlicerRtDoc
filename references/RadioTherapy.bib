	novel rapid correction scheme that
	
	can be used on-line to correct both interfractional setup variation
	and anatomy change for HN RT.
	
	The scheme consists of two major steps: (1) Segment aperture morphing
	(SAM) and (2) segment
	
	weight optimization SWO. SAM is accomplished by applying the spatial
	relationship between the
	
	apertures and the contours of the planning target and organs at risk
	OARs to the new target and
	
	OAR contours. The new target contours are transferred from planning
	target contours to the CT of
	
	the day by means of deformable registration (MIMVISTA). The dose distribution
	for each new
	
	aperture was generated using a planning system with a fast dose engine
	and hardware and was input
	
	into a newly developed SWO package using fast sequential quadratic
	programming. The entire
	
	scheme was tested based on the daily CT images acquired for representative
	HN IMRT cases
	
	treated with a linac and CT-on-Rails combo. It was found that the
	target coverage and/or OAR
	
	sparing was degraded based on the CT of the day with the current standard
	repositioning from rigid
	
	registration. This degradation can be corrected by the SAM/SWO scheme.
	The target coverage and
	
	OAR sparing for the SAM/SWO plans were found to be equivalent to the
	original plan. The
	
	SAM/SWO process took 5–8 min for the head and neck cases studied.
	The proposed aperture
	
	morphing with weight optimization is an effective on-line approach
	for correcting interfractional
	
	patient setup and anatomic changes for head and neck cancer radiotherapy.},

	is rapidly evolving.
	
	Methods of executing beam intensity modulation have included individually
	designed
	
	compensators, static multi-leaf collimators (MLC), dynamic MLC, and
	sequential (serial) tomotherapy.
	
	We have developed helical tomotherapy as an innovative solution to
	overcome some
	
	of the limitations of other IMRT systems. The unique physical design
	of helical tomotherapy
	
	allows the realization of the concepts of adaptive radiotherapy and
	conformal avoidance. In
	
	principle, these advances should improve normal tissue sparing and
	permit dose reconstruction
	
	and verification, thereby allowing significant biologically effective
	dose escalation.
	
	Recent radiobiological findings can be translated into altered fractionation
	schemes that aim
	
	to improve the local control and long-term survival. This strategy
	is being tested at the University
	
	of Wisconsin using helical tomotherapy with its highly precise delivery
	and verification
	
	system along with meticulous and practical forms of immobilization.
	Innovative techniques
	
	such optical guidance, respiratory gating, and ultrasound assessments
	are being designed
	
	and tailored for helical tomotherapy use. The intrinsic capability
	of helical tomotherapy for
	
	megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging for IMRT image-guidance is being optimized.
	
	The unique features of helical tomotherapy might allow implementation
	of image-guided
	
	IMRT that was previously impossible or impractical. Here we review
	the technological, physical,
	
	and radiobiological rationale for the ongoing and upcoming clinical
	trials that will use
	
	image-guided IMRT in the form of helical tomotherapy; and we describe

  abstract = {Background and purpose: To evaluate the benefits of adaptive radiotherapy
	for bladder cancer in decreasing
	
	irradiation of small bowel.
	
	Material and methods: Five patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer
	received adaptive radiotherapy
	
	to a total dose of 55.8–65 Gy with daily cone-beam computed tomography
	scanning. The whole bladder
	
	was treated to 45–50.4 Gy, followed by a partial bladder boost. The
	plan of the day was chosen from 3 to 4
	
	pre-planned treatment plans according to the visible extent of bladder
	wall in cone-beam computed
	
	tomography images. Dose volume histograms for intestinal cavity volumes
	were constructed and compared
	
	with corresponding histograms calculated for conventional non-adaptive
	radiotherapy with single
	
	treatment plan of 2 cm CTV–PTV margins. CTV dose coverage in adaptive
	treatment technique was compared
	
	with CTV dose coverage in conventional radiotherapy.
	
	Results: The average volume of intestinal cavity receivingP45 Gy was
	reduced from 335 ± 106 cm3 to
	
	180 ± 113 cm3 (1SD). The maximum volume of intestinal cavity spared
	at 45 Gy on a single patient
	
	was 240 cm3, while the minimum volume was 65 cm3. The corresponding
	reduction in average intestinal
	
	cavity volume receivingP45 Gy calculated for the whole bladder treatment
	only was 66 ± 36 cm3. CTV
	
	dose coverage was improved on two out of five patients and decreased
	on three patients.
	
	Conclusions: Adaptive radiotherapy considerably reduces dose to the
	small bowel, while maintaining the
	
	dose coverage of CTV at similar level when compared to the conventional
	treatment technique.},

  abstract = {In prostate radiation therapy, inter-fractional organ motion/deformation
	has posed significant challenges on reliable daily dose delivery.
	To correct for this issue, off-line re-optimization and online re-positioning
	have been used clinically. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
	images guided radiation therapy (AIGRT) scheme that combines these
	two correction methods in an anatomy-driven fashion. The AIGRT process
	first tries to find a best plan for the daily target from a plan
	pool, which consists of the original CT plan and all previous re-optimized
	plans. If successful, the selected plan is used for daily treatment
	with translational shifts. Otherwise, the AIGRT invokes the re-optimization
	process of the CT plan for the anatomy of the day, which is afterward
	added to the plan pool as a candidate for future fractions. The AIGRT
	scheme is evaluated by comparisons with daily re-optimization and
	online re-positioning techniques based on daily target coverage,
	organs at risk (OAR) sparing and implementation efficiency. Simulated
	treatment courses for 18 patients with re-optimization alone, re-positioning
	alone and AIGRT shows that AIGRT offers reliable daily target coverage
	that is highly comparable to daily re-optimization and significantly
	improves from re-positioning. AIGRT
	
	is also seen to provide improved OAR sparing compared to re-positioning.
	Apart from dosimetric benefits, AIGRT in addition offers an efficient
	scheme to integrate re-optimization to current re-positioning-based
	IGRT workflow},
