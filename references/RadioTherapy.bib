  title = {An on-line replanning method for head and neck adaptive radiotherapy},
  journal = {Med. Phys},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {36},
  pages = {4776-4790},
  abstract = {Daily setup for head and neck HN radiotherapy RT can vary randomly
	due to neck rotation and
	
	anatomy change. These differences cannot be totally corrected by the
	current practice of image
	
	guided RT with translational repositioning. The authors present a
	novel rapid correction scheme that
	
	can be used on-line to correct both interfractional setup variation
	and anatomy change for HN RT.
	
	The scheme consists of two major steps: (1) Segment aperture morphing
	(SAM) and (2) segment
	
	weight optimization SWO. SAM is accomplished by applying the spatial
	relationship between the
	
	apertures and the contours of the planning target and organs at risk
	OARs to the new target and
	
	OAR contours. The new target contours are transferred from planning
	target contours to the CT of
	
	the day by means of deformable registration (MIMVISTA). The dose distribution
	for each new
	
	aperture was generated using a planning system with a fast dose engine
	and hardware and was input
	
	into a newly developed SWO package using fast sequential quadratic
	programming. The entire
	
	scheme was tested based on the daily CT images acquired for representative
	HN IMRT cases
	
	treated with a linac and CT-on-Rails combo. It was found that the
	target coverage and/or OAR
	
	sparing was degraded based on the CT of the day with the current standard
	repositioning from rigid
	
	registration. This degradation can be corrected by the SAM/SWO scheme.
	The target coverage and
	
	OAR sparing for the SAM/SWO plans were found to be equivalent to the
	original plan. The
	
	SAM/SWO process took 5–8 min for the head and neck cases studied.
	The proposed aperture
	
	morphing with weight optimization is an effective on-line approach
	for correcting interfractional
	
	patient setup and anatomic changes for head and neck cancer radiotherapy.},

  abstract = {This study examined the variation of dose–volume histogram (DVH) data
	sourced from multiple radiotherapy treatment planning systems (TPSs).
	Treatment plan exports were obtained from 33 Australian and New Zealand
	centres during a dosimetry study. Plan information, including DVH
	data, was exported from the TPS at each centre and reviewed in a
	digital review system (SWAN). The review system was then used to
	produce an independent calculation ofDVHinformation for each delineated
	structure. The relationships between DVHs extracted from each TPS
	and independently calculated were examined, particularly in terms
	of the influence of CT scan slice and pixel widths, the resolution
	of dose calculation grids and the TPS manufacturer. Calculation of
	total volume and DVH data was consistent between SWAN and each TPS,
	with the small discrepancies found tending to increase with decreasing
	structure size. This was significantly influenced by the TPS model
	used to derive the data. For target structures covered with relatively
	uniform dose distributions, there was a significant difference between
	the minimum dose in each TPS-exported DVH and that calculated independently.},

	The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) 
	
	
	standard is now widely implemented in radiology as the standard for
	
	
	diagnostic imaging. It has also been extended for use in various sub-
	
	
	specialties. One of the first extensions was applied to radiation
	therapy 
	
	
	and is known as DICOM-RT. In addition to the protocol used in the
	
	
	DICOM standard, seven DICOM-RT objects—namely, RT Image, 
	
	
	RT Structure Set, RT Plan, RT Dose, RT Beams Treatment Record, 
	
	
	RT Brachy Treatment Record, and RT Treatment Summary Record—
	
	
	have been created, each with a well-defined data model. The data 
	
	
	models set the standard for integration of radiation therapy informa-
	
	
	tion for an electronic patient record and would facilitate the interoper-
	
	
	ability of different radiation therapy systems, thus making possible
	the 
	
	
	sharing of information from different systems.

  journal = {Semin. Radiat. Oncol.},

  pages = {130-137},
  abstract = {Adaptive radiotherapy has been introduced to manage an individual’s
	treatment by, including patient-specific treatment variation identified
	and quantified during the course of
	
	radiotherapy in the treatment planning and delivering optimization.
	Early studies have demonstrated that this technique could significantly
	improve the therapeutic ratio by safely
	
	reducing the large target margin that has to be used in conventional
	radiotherapy for prostate cancer treatment. Clinical application
	of off-line image-guided adaptive radiotherapy
	
	for prostate cancer has demonstrated encouraging clinical outcome.
	Long-term clinical follow-up has shown significant improvement in
	terms of tumor control and low toxicity
	
	profile, emphasizing the beneficial effect of image-guidance and adaptive
	treatment. Continuous development in adaptive radiotherapy has made
	possible additional increases in
	
	target dose by further reducing target margin when using online image-guided
	adaptive intensity-modulated radiation therapy. However, clinical
	implementation of new techniques
	
	should be explored cautiously and should include a comprehensive management
	strategy to address uncertainties in target definition and delineation
	in the preclinical implementation
	
	studies.},
