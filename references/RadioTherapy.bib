	The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) 
	
	standard is now widely implemented in radiology as the standard for
	
	
	diagnostic imaging. It has also been extended for use in various sub-
	
	specialties. One of the first extensions was applied to radiation
	therapy 
	
	and is known as DICOM-RT. In addition to the protocol used in the
	
	
	DICOM standard, seven DICOM-RT objects—namely, RT Image, 
	
	RT Structure Set, RT Plan, RT Dose, RT Beams Treatment Record, 
	
	RT Brachy Treatment Record, and RT Treatment Summary Record—
	
	have been created, each with a well-defined data model. The data 
	
	models set the standard for integration of radiation therapy informa-
	
	tion for an electronic patient record and would facilitate the interoper-
	
	ability of different radiation therapy systems, thus making possible
	the 
	
	sharing of information from different systems.
