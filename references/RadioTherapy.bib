  title = {An on-line replanning method for head and neck adaptive radiotherapy},
  journal = {Med. Phys},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {36},
  pages = {4776-4790},
  abstract = {Daily setup for head and neck HN radiotherapy RT can vary randomly
	due to neck rotation and
	
	anatomy change. These differences cannot be totally corrected by the
	current practice of image
	
	guided RT with translational repositioning. The authors present a
	novel rapid correction scheme that
	
	can be used on-line to correct both interfractional setup variation
	and anatomy change for HN RT.
	
	The scheme consists of two major steps: (1) Segment aperture morphing
	(SAM) and (2) segment
	
	weight optimization SWO. SAM is accomplished by applying the spatial
	relationship between the
	
	apertures and the contours of the planning target and organs at risk
	OARs to the new target and
	
	OAR contours. The new target contours are transferred from planning
	target contours to the CT of
	
	the day by means of deformable registration (MIMVISTA). The dose distribution
	for each new
	
	aperture was generated using a planning system with a fast dose engine
	and hardware and was input
	
	into a newly developed SWO package using fast sequential quadratic
	programming. The entire
	
	scheme was tested based on the daily CT images acquired for representative
	HN IMRT cases
	
	treated with a linac and CT-on-Rails combo. It was found that the
	target coverage and/or OAR
	
	sparing was degraded based on the CT of the day with the current standard
	repositioning from rigid
	
	registration. This degradation can be corrected by the SAM/SWO scheme.
	The target coverage and
	
	OAR sparing for the SAM/SWO plans were found to be equivalent to the
	original plan. The
	
	SAM/SWO process took 5–8 min for the head and neck cases studied.
	The proposed aperture
	
	morphing with weight optimization is an effective on-line approach
	for correcting interfractional
	
	patient setup and anatomic changes for head and neck cancer radiotherapy.},

	total volume and DVH data was consistent between SWAN and each TPS,
	with the small discrepancies found tending to increase with decreasing

	The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) 
	
	
	standard is now widely implemented in radiology as the standard for
	
	
	diagnostic imaging. It has also been extended for use in various sub-
	
	
	specialties. One of the first extensions was applied to radiation
	therapy 
	
	
	and is known as DICOM-RT. In addition to the protocol used in the
	
	
	DICOM standard, seven DICOM-RT objects—namely, RT Image, 
	
	
	RT Structure Set, RT Plan, RT Dose, RT Beams Treatment Record, 
	
	
	RT Brachy Treatment Record, and RT Treatment Summary Record—
	
	
	have been created, each with a well-defined data model. The data 
	
	
	models set the standard for integration of radiation therapy informa-
	
	
	tion for an electronic patient record and would facilitate the interoper-
	
	
	ability of different radiation therapy systems, thus making possible
	the 
	
	
	sharing of information from different systems.

  abstract = {In prostate radiation therapy, inter-fractional organ motion/deformation
	has posed significant challenges on reliable daily dose delivery.
	To correct for this issue, off-line re-optimization and online re-positioning
	have been used clinically. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
	images guided radiation therapy (AIGRT) scheme that combines these
	two correction methods in an anatomy-driven fashion. The AIGRT process
	first tries to find a best plan for the daily target from a plan
	pool, which consists of the original CT plan and all previous re-optimized
	plans. If successful, the selected plan is used for daily treatment
	with translational shifts. Otherwise, the AIGRT invokes the re-optimization
	process of the CT plan for the anatomy of the day, which is afterward
	added to the plan pool as a candidate for future fractions. The AIGRT
	scheme is evaluated by comparisons with daily re-optimization and
	online re-positioning techniques based on daily target coverage,
	organs at risk (OAR) sparing and implementation efficiency. Simulated
	treatment courses for 18 patients with re-optimization alone, re-positioning
	alone and AIGRT shows that AIGRT offers reliable daily target coverage
	that is highly comparable to daily re-optimization and significantly
	improves from re-positioning. AIGRT
	
	is also seen to provide improved OAR sparing compared to re-positioning.
	Apart from dosimetric benefits, AIGRT in addition offers an efficient
	scheme to integrate re-optimization to current re-positioning-based
	IGRT workflow},

	based Image Guided Radiotherapy
	
	(IGRT) to increase the accuracy of bladder irradiation using a ‘plan
	of the day’ adaptive radiotherapy
	
	(ART) technique.
	
	Materials and methods: Ten patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer
	underwent bladder preservation
	
	with trimodality therapy in an ongoing trial. All patients received
	64 Gy/32# to the whole bladder and
	
	seven of them received a boost of 68 Gy/32# to the tumour bed. The
	ART technique entailed the generation
	
	of six IMRT plans for each patient, using six isotropic PTVs of 5–30
	mm applied to the bladder volume
	
	(CTV) to generate the PTVs. Megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging was done
	to correct positioning errors
	
	and choose the ‘plan of the day’.
	
	Results: Post treatment MVCT scans (315 scans) were used to generate
	multiple anisotropic PTVs for
	
	three hypothetical scenarios. Overall, coverage of anterior and superior
	walls required larger margins
	
	than other walls. Maximum geographical miss, in spite of IGRT, was
	noted for the superior (13.8%) and
	
	anterior walls (10.3%).
	
	Conclusions: Plan of the day ART is a feasible and promising technique
	for optimal treatment and dose
	
	escalation in bladder cancer.},

	irradiation of small bowel.
	
	Material and methods: Five patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer
	received adaptive radiotherapy
	
	to a total dose of 55.8–65 Gy with daily cone-beam computed tomography
	scanning. The whole bladder
	
	was treated to 45–50.4 Gy, followed by a partial bladder boost. The
	plan of the day was chosen from 3 to 4
	
	pre-planned treatment plans according to the visible extent of bladder
	wall in cone-beam computed
	
	tomography images. Dose volume histograms for intestinal cavity volumes
	were constructed and compared
	
	with corresponding histograms calculated for conventional non-adaptive
	radiotherapy with single
	
	treatment plan of 2 cm CTV–PTV margins. CTV dose coverage in adaptive
	treatment technique was compared
	
	with CTV dose coverage in conventional radiotherapy.
	
	Results: The average volume of intestinal cavity receivingP45 Gy was
	reduced from 335 ± 106 cm3 to
	
	180 ± 113 cm3 (1SD). The maximum volume of intestinal cavity spared
	at 45 Gy on a single patient
	
	was 240 cm3, while the minimum volume was 65 cm3. The corresponding
	reduction in average intestinal
	
	cavity volume receivingP45 Gy calculated for the whole bladder treatment
	only was 66 ± 36 cm3. CTV
	
	dose coverage was improved on two out of five patients and decreased
	on three patients.
	
	Conclusions: Adaptive radiotherapy considerably reduces dose to the
	small bowel, while maintaining the
	
	dose coverage of CTV at similar level when compared to the conventional
	treatment technique.},

	Methods of executing beam intensity modulation have included individually
	designed
	
	compensators, static multi-leaf collimators (MLC), dynamic MLC, and
	sequential (serial) tomotherapy.
	
	We have developed helical tomotherapy as an innovative solution to
	overcome some
	
	of the limitations of other IMRT systems. The unique physical design
	of helical tomotherapy
	
	allows the realization of the concepts of adaptive radiotherapy and
	conformal avoidance. In
	
	principle, these advances should improve normal tissue sparing and
	permit dose reconstruction
	
	and verification, thereby allowing significant biologically effective
	dose escalation.
	
	Recent radiobiological findings can be translated into altered fractionation
	schemes that aim
	
	to improve the local control and long-term survival. This strategy
	is being tested at the University
	
	of Wisconsin using helical tomotherapy with its highly precise delivery
	and verification
	
	system along with meticulous and practical forms of immobilization.
	Innovative techniques
	
	such optical guidance, respiratory gating, and ultrasound assessments
	are being designed
	
	and tailored for helical tomotherapy use. The intrinsic capability
	of helical tomotherapy for
	
	megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging for IMRT image-guidance is being optimized.
	
	The unique features of helical tomotherapy might allow implementation
	of image-guided
	
	IMRT that was previously impossible or impractical. Here we review
	the technological, physical,
	
	and radiobiological rationale for the ongoing and upcoming clinical
	trials that will use

  journal = {Phys. Med. Biol},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {56},
  pages = {4947–4965},
  abstract = {With on-line image guidance (IG), prostate shifts relative to the
	bony anatomy
	
	can be corrected by realigning the patient with respect to the treatment
	fields.
	
	In image guided intensity modulated proton therapy (IG-IMPT), because
	the
	
	proton range is more sensitive to the material it travels through,
	the realignment
	
	may introduce large dose variations. This effect is studied in this
	work and
	
	an on-line adaptive procedure is proposed to restore the planned dose
	to the
	
	target. A 2D anthropomorphic phantom was constructed from a real prostate
	
	patient’s CT image. Two-field laterally opposing spot 3D-modulation
	and 24-
	
	field full arc distal edge tracking (DET) plans were generated with
	a prescription
	
	of 70 Gy to the planning target volume. For the simulated delivery,
	we
	
	considered two types of procedures: the non-adaptive procedure and
	the on-line
	
	adaptive procedure. In the non-adaptive procedure, only patient realignment
	to
	
	match the prostate location in the planning CT was performed. In the
	on-line
	
	adaptive procedure, on top of the patient realignment, the kinetic
	energy for
	
	each individual proton pencil beam was re-determined from the on-line
	CT
	
	image acquired after the realignment and subsequently used for delivery.
	Dose
	
	distributions were re-calculated for individual fractions for different
	plans and
	
	different delivery procedures. The results show, without adaptive,
	that both the
	
	3D-modulation and the DET plans experienced delivered dose degradation
	by
	
	having large cold or hot spots in the prostate. The DET plan had worse
	dose
	
	degradation than the 3D-modulation plan. The adaptive procedure effectively
	
	restored the planned dose distribution in the DET plan, with delivered
	prostate
	
	D98%, D50% and D2% values less than 1% from the prescription. In the
	3Dmodulation
	
	plan, in certain cases the adaptive procedure was not effective
	
	to reduce the delivered dose degradation and yield similar results
	as the nonadaptive
	
	procedure. In conclusion, based on this 2Dphantom study, by updating
	
	the proton pencil beam energy from the on-line image after realignment,
	this
	
	on-line adaptive procedure is necessary and effective for the DET-based
	IGIMPT.
	
	Without dose re-calculation and re-optimization, it could be easily
	
	incorporated into the clinical workflow.},
